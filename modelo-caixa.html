            <h2 class="titulo">NASA Administrator Statement on Moon to Mars Initiative,
            FY 2021 Budget</h2>

            <p>The following is a statement from NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine:

                “President Donald Trump’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget for NASA is worthy of 21st century exploration and discovery.
                 The President’s budget invests more than $25 billion 
                 in NASA to fortify our innovative human space exploration program while 
                 maintaining strong support for our agency’s full suite of science, 
                 aeronautics, and technology work.
                
                “The budget proposed represents a 12 percent increase and
                 makes this one of the strongest budgets in NASA history. 
                 The reinforced support from the President comes at a critical time 
                 as we lay the foundations for landing the first woman and the next 
                 man on the South Pole of the Moon by 2024. 
                 This budget keeps us firmly on that path.
                
                “We are preparing to achieve pivotal milestones this year in development 
                of the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway. These make up the backbone of our 
                Artemis program and are fully supported by this budget. They constitute our ability to build a sustainable
                 lunar presence and eventually send human missions to Mars.</p>
